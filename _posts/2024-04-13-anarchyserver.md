This server will have an interesting twist to my regular style of SMP's. Instead this server will be an anarchy server and, this article will explain how it will all work.

# Folia
That's right! This server runs on Folia which is a multithreaded Minecraft server made by the PaperMC team. Why Folia over any other server? Folia has been chosen due to the nature of this being an anarchy server and that I am expecting server sided lag to happen. You will not need any special client to open the server due the server being completely vanilla, gameplay wise. Java edition will be required until [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) with [Floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/) can be implemented.

# Rules
Well it is an anarchy server so anything is allowed right? Not exactly, breaking the law is not allowed (e.g. DDoS, Doxxing, etc) and crashing the server isn't allowed. However, you are allowed to cheat and use hacked clients and say anything you want in chat.
